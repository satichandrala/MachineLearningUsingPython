> This repo consists of the code for using Applied Data Science with Python
## Data Science : 
-Scientific Methods, processes, algorithms, systems.
- Provides insights from raw data and can be applied in different sectors. Now-a-days it's being used in health care to forest monitoring.
- With increase in the amount of data volume, and the big data (3Vs), use of datascience is extended to different fields so as to support the growth of businesses.
- From a simple linear regression model to the GANs which produce images of fake photos (the people never existed before, just fake photos) to digital art, data science has grown widely and Machine learning will continue to grow.
- Although it existed since the [1900s](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwihlYLHoKj4AhU8wAIHHRIBAegQFnoECEcQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fbernardmarr%2F2016%2F02%2F19%2Fa-short-history-of-machine-learning-every-manager-should-read%2F&usg=AOvVaw1-2ZMox4W5-747Gm1TS4Vg), the resources available today, are better aligned with the development of new technologies.
